# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to expand upon our dashboard framework. We had a created completed dashboard for demographic information and now needed to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer in our belly button biodiversity data. Specifically, the goal was to update the dashboard to identify the top 10 bacterial species in the subject's belly buttons. We were instructed to create a bar graph, bubble plot & gauge to reflect the outcome for each participant. 

## Results
The following screenshot is taken from our dashboard reflecting our updated work for subject 940.

The above image reflects a functional dashboard reflecting the data outcome for each subject. The display is further updated when the user inputs other subject id numbers (as exmplified by subject 954).

Lastly, we added additional elements to the dashboard to make it more user enjoyable by adding a photo of a microscope, changing the background color to black, and changing the color on the bubble chart to differing hues of red.

## Conclusions
We were successfully able to produce a functional dashboard that is user friendly.
